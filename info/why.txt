        <p>First, I want my occupation is flexible that can work in worldwide, and the language of software are all common in the world, we use the same broswer, coding with the same language, and every country is developing software business.</p>
        <p>I was amazed that Google offers a cloud gaming service called <a href='https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Stadia' target='_blank'>Stadia</a>, you can play 4K resolution games via the browser-Google Chrome. This let me think about the posibility of browser, maybe oneday you can do anything only by a browser, and you don't have to install any software or application in your PC, just a browser.</p>
        <p>And the other thing impress me is the <a href='https://ithome.com.tw/news/132736' target="_blank">tax system</a> in Taiwan. In the past, Taiwan citizens complain the online tax system is too hard to use, but now you can pay the taxes online by various browser and OS, and is easy-understanding.</p>
        <p>I think there are so many websites are using the old framework or techniques, and new services and things are being developed, which means it needs a lot of backend engineers to do this work, that's why I want to be a backend engineer. </p>
