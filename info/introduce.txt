<p>  Hi I'm William, was born in Taoyuan, Taiwan. In undergraduate, My research subject is about vibration of beam, we simulate the
vibration of beam by software called Abaqus, to calculate the natural frequency of vibration. Also in order to get the experimental  
data, we have an experiment of fixed beam, we compare both data from simulation and experiment, and figure out what cause the 
difference.</p>
<p>  And I went to Tainan for master degree of mechanical engineering. My thesis is about simulation of quantum mechanics, because the 
simulation only can operate on Linux system, so I learn some simple sommand of terminal, and how to install open source by terminal, 
also write a python script in order to transfer the data made by one open source into another open source.</p>
<p>  Now I'm working in AUO as a mechanical engineer. Our job is to develop some new structure and techniques. The product we develop is  vary from mobile to TV, it's not an easy job.</p>
